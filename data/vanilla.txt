Song:   Go Ill
Typed by: mcalcatrazz@blackplanet.com

[Verse 1]
Get on up...i walk the beat and walk it with clarity
I wanna' make sure all's hearin' me
Ducks who's bummin', I found your hide away
I'm livin' large y'all so by the way
Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud
On the strengths, y'all, I'm takin' bows now
Kickin' up lyrics that others wanna' rock to
Rock like me, y'all this you can't do
The v, the a, the n, the i, the lla y'all
It's vanilla

[Chorus]
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up

[Verse 2]
Hold on girl, let your feet move free
cause you move to the groove of vanilla i-c-e
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap
If you a ho, get off my lap
cause ice stands for bein' so cold
That's a nickname I got for bein' so bold
Jerome stands for m.p.a
My personal assistant, every day
I'm not an mc who come here to play
Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm goin' all the way
Rhymes are clean, there's no need to be ill
And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic
When I see one, I got to have it
I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum
What you gonna' do? don't you play dumb
Busy like kizzy, groovin' like rubin
Don't care what you do, just keep movin'
Shakin' your limbs until they wear thin
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin
Simple like simon, with ice rhymin'
Some mc's fakin' it, but I'm the diamond
I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call
You watch your fries, boy, or I'm gonna' take yours

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Start skeezin' and move that hip girl
Get in the mood and don't you quit
Smooth as slime, king rhyme
Rock it boy, cause it's a craime
I'll make you scream like you're in between
When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king
cause I'm hungry as a dog, i'll eat up
My rhymes are runnin', don't interrupt
cause I'm a throne overtaker, not an mc faker
I like my coffee, but I can't stand sanka

Typed by: mcalcatrazz@blackplanet.com

Your bad self..

[Verse 1]
All right, stop, spread yourself around
Get loose girl, let's break it down
Get down, straight to the floor
Get excited and beg for more
As I go on, flow on with a smile
Pay attention to my style
Dirty but hot, ya' know what I mean?
Get loose girl like a sex fiend, let's do it
cause you know what I want
Me and you babe go one on one
Get freaky and I do the same
Get hot and I ride like a sex machine

[Chorus]
Ice cool and you're colder than ever, I like it
Ice cool and you're colder than ever

[Verse 2]
Ice cold, cooler than ever
Never say never cause I'm so damn clever
Lickin' your lips, I'm ridin' your hips
V.i.p. posse and we're pimps
Be on the lookout in your vicinity
I'm robbin' virgins of their virginity
Like robin hood gave to the poor
I rock kashla and now she wants more
She calls everday, it's gettin' kinda' silly
But she rides my saddle like bronco billy
In a rodeo somewhere out west
She screams out "vanilla ice, you're the best!"
Echoing out, can you hear?
She screams out everywhere
Just a pimp and you know
Snatchin' women, so, yo!
You can beg, plead and tell me you love me
But there's no way i'd put a girl above me
Unless it's sex and you wanna' ride
Jump on my saddle, baby, and get live

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Move your body all around
This is the dope jam, so get down
Now that you like what I'm sayin' admit it
This is the jam and vanilla just did it
I made you work 'til your butt got sore
In other words, I'm about to get raw
On stage, it's a v.i.p., doin' dances from a to zpumpin' it, pushin' it, stick it hard
I freaked your girl in the back of your car
I wore a jimmy that I slapped on
Popped a rubber duckie, so bought me a trojan
Get ready, hyped into the groove
As I practiced to make your body move
You're fienin' for a meanin', oh yes, I'm comin'
Vanilla ice is here so you suckers start runnin'
This is the jam I know you're gonna like
Deshay he cuts like a knife
He won't smirk and he won't smile
Deshay get funky for a while
Yo, it's time for me to pump, pump..
Pump up the volume

[Chorus]

Song:   Ice Is Workin It
Typed by: mcalcatrazz@blackplanet.com

[Verse 1]
Yo! here comes the intro
It's time to let it go
I live the life of my rhyme, I think i'll let it show
So, keep it goin' so the mic can stay warm
Then I know i've been doin' my job 'cause there'll be sweat pourin'
So pick and choose your weapon but don't slip
I'm here to kill you boys with the flex of my mic grip
So pump your fist like this, but don't miss
The hook and the break when you decide to dance to this
Lyrical concept that's meant for the dance floor
I know you adore cause that's what you came for
The ice rhymer is back and livin' large
And when I'm at a show you better wear camouflage
cause there was plenty who thought I couldn't swing this
But now all I get from the crowd is just a pumped fist
So sing along with the chorus 'cause it's a hit
Or stay at home alone 'cause ice will be workin it

[Chorus 2x]
Work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it, work it
work it work it, ice, yea! c'mon and work it baby

Go white boy, go white boy, go!
Check out the hook. vanilla ice, yep, yep

[Verse 2]
I'm makin' a killin' and chillin' because I'm cool as an ice pack
You're lovin' everything when I think of a new track
I keep my rhyme flowin', notice it's right on time
And separate the wax and keep my mic in line
So put your body in motion and let me know that you're there
And those playin' the wall don't be scared
Cause it's a foundation of breaks put to a beat
Strong as concrete 'cause I'm rockin' the beat
I'm in rock mode now' cause I'm steppin' like a soldier
Move to the groove and try to hold your composure
Never the less I'm back to attack
I came to manifest, and express to this dope track
Blow off the lid for the kid I get nice
That's why the ladies scream...oh! Vanilla Ice
Forthcomin' I'm risin' to the top
The real definition of funk is put to hip hop
That's what I though, you're cause by the friction
Pens to the pad when I'm shakin' the mixin'
What I like to hear is a drummer get wicked
The tone of a vocal thrown and then kick it
Don't be surprised if your eyeballs swell
I know it's hard to regard 'cause I'm loved by the females
Masses of many, which is plenty, comes to a halt
No one's in the runnin', so I guess that is my fault
So pump up the crowd and give 'em somethin' to step to
My dj's at his max to enhance what I bring you
The concepts hittin' so follow along like a cookbook
Acknowledge the pros from all the titles I took, yea
The crowd's at ease when I breat through the mic end
As I whip up a dance better move all the mic stands
I go to work on the floor like a wet mop
If you've ever been moved, check it out when I rock

Chorus

[Verse 3]
Throw your hands in the air and let's get hyper
Flip this thing and sting like a viper
Rollin' with the rhythm, I did it for my opponent
If there was a crown to be taken, yea, I would own it
Believe that my rhyme is spoken like it has to be
With slang to stain it's a sheer catastrophe
Sheer to the point, to the point it's like lethal
The dope that I'm sellin' is not even illegal
But, still knowck you out with clout to make you shout
To rock the party people sho 'em what it's all about
Money, yea, is the key to all problems
If you believe that, then you should surely solve 'em
Cause I got the key, the key to attack
The knowledge from my dome, from the top of my track
To my foes, I can show I can flow 'cause I'm legit
Thinkin' of a new dance, ice will be workin' it

Song:   I Love You
Typed by; mcalcatrazz@blackplanet.com

[Verse 1]
Girl, I keep thinkin' of how I feel
When I'm in your arms gives me a chill
Just knowin' that you want me by your side
Mellows my mind and enhances my pride
Girl, I need you more and more each day
Believe me when I tell you I'm here to stay
I'm captured by your love and your pretty smile
You devastating beauty and your sweet profile

[Chorus]
I love you, cause I love you
I love you, cause I love you

[Verse 2]
You're so fine, let's wine and dine
I'm so happy that you are mine
Thinking of you I melt with desire
Take you in my arms, let love take us higher
To hear you talk, sounds so sweet
When you're close to me I feel your heat
Girl, I want you and you want me
And it'll last until eternity
You're like the snow fallin' from the sky
So clean, like the look in your eye
You're my queen, i'll buy you everything
Yes, girl, even diamond rings
Cause you're my lady, and this love is true
Every sunset makes me think of you
And i'll never forget what you mean to me
Comin' straight from the heart of vanilla i-c-e

Chorus

[Outro]
Hello girl, when I first saw you. it was love at first sight
We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same
I know I haven't said it much before...well...it's because
See, I get all choked up inside. it just doesn't wanna
Come out. I don't know. maybe this'll help all the bad
Things i've done. so, no matter what goes on, no matter
What happens, always remember...I love you!

[Intro]
Yea...vanillas' stand the world on a chair, yea!
Vanilla 'll knock 'em down on their rear, yea!
Vanilla 'll make 'em all stand up and cheer, yea!
He's the vanilla! break, break, break down

[Verse 1]
Sparklin' like a towerin' inferno
You wanna' learn my songs, this ain't no journal
It blemished my rhyme, because I'm drawin' the line
Don't celebrate too soon, 'cause I'm goin' for mine
Just a character in a made up cartoon
Like witchel and hazel, boy, you're pushin' a broom
So get a new life or come equipped with the best
Mark another one for ice, let the microphone rest
Just listen to my groove, the beat is strong
And i'll rock it now, I need a microphone
I'm in the mood to dance, I'm in the mood to prance
You tried me once but now you're takin' a chance
Because I rock with flavor, hard as lifesaver
You asked for dope, ha...that's what I gave ya'
A chance to go but now you move too slow
My juice is pumped and I'm ready to go

[Chorus]
Go...it's a party...come on...let's do this...come on..

[Verse 2]
Real good...into a new phase, jumpin' up the airwaves
And now you're amazed 'cause it's hip hop that you crave
Becuase I'm hyped like an addict, there's no drug involved
The only thing I need is my record revolved
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador
I saw my style, my soul, up on the dance floor
I wanna' see ya' shake, shake and shiver
You're a charity case, and ice is the giver
I'm givin' you what you want but you're dumb and naive
You can't cope with the dop ice has concieved
Which is a dope jam, hotter than the third degree
You tried my style but I burn you see
I'm ice and I'm cold, I'm buildin' igloos of gold
You wanna' bite my style, you gotta' have soul
'cause a dope like this is not easy to come by
You don't buy it on, it comes out your hi-fi

[Chorus]
It's a party...come on...'let's do this..

[Verse 3]
You think it's funy to lack but I'm a brother to mack
The 808 kickin' base from a dope drum track
I'm the coolest of cool, kickin' cools silly fools
You r posse's takin' a dip and vanilla's the pool
Get ready for my ritual, it's at its' peak
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak
Intruders get slayed, my pockets get paid
The girlie is jockin' it and just got laid
See I'm the press you elect, keep the record erect
In effect, damn, ain't that what you expect?
Earthquake is on the funk, my homie's not a punk
Take you antique rhymes and self 'em as junk
You see, we won't come front' and sellin' drugs and all that shit
Fake caddies, mack daddies, ain't even legit
So, get a beeper, you're a sleeper and you need to wake up
So make the record transform so carwin vegas

[Chorus]
It's a party...come on...let's do this..

[Outro]
Do it! we don't need no music
Cause all we wanna' do, is sing and dance and party down
I'm the best, he's the vanilla

[Chorus]
It's a party...come on...let's do this..

Typed by: dallas112263@yahoo.com

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy

I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell
In ecstasy in the back of me
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy

I'm lettin' my drug kick in
It controls my mouth and I begin
To just let it flow, let my concepts go
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!

Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be
And if you don't give a damn, then
Why you starin' at me
So get off 'cause I control the stage
There's no dissin' allowed
I'm in my own phase
The girlies say they love me and that is ok
And I can dance better than any kid n' play

Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music, white boy I can't hear you, say it
Play that funky music say it, say it, say
Play that funky music, white boy it, come on
Yea, a little bit louder
now come on, come on

Stage 2 -- Yea the one ya' wanna listen to
It's off my head so let the beat play through
So I can funk it up and make it sound good
1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious
I'm an effect and that you can bet
I can take a fly girl and make her wet

I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah
There's no denyin', You can try to hang
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style
Over and over, practice makes perfect
But not if you're a loafer

You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls
Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on Come on
Play that funky music white boy Let's do it

VIP. Vanilla Ice yep, yep, I'm comin' hard like a rhino
Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'
'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse

Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi
Startled by the bases hittin' ground
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic
You trapped me once and I thought that
You might have it
So step down and lend me your ear
'89 in my time! You, '90 is my year
Play that funky music
Play that funky music, white boy
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, I
Play that funky music white boy can't hear you

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it
So don't be mad and don't be sad
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure
So come up close and don't be square
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere

You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong
So come on, everybody and sing this song

Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go
play that funky music Go white boy, go white boy, go
Lay down and boogie and play that funky music till you die
Play that funky music Come on, Come on, let me hear
Play that funky music white boy you say it, say it
Play that funky music A little louder now
Play that funky music, white boy Come on, Come on, Come on

Typed by: mcalcatrazz@blackplanet.com

[Intro]
Strictly from the islands, vanilla ice
The man jam down reggae music
Mash it up ice, mash it

[Verse 1]
I got the rhyme to keep the body pumpin'
Turn the party out while the people are jumpin'
Reggae style at the top of my list
Is hitting real hard like mike tyson's fist
It is so good that the girlies goin' crazy
Vanilla's on the mic and you know I'm not lazy
I'm pumpin' up the lyrics in a smooth way
I drop 'em like a bum rush much as what we say
The other mc's try to duplicate
But with the rosta man they just mediate

[Chorus]
Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth
You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve
Rosta man you know you sound so sweet
I like the way you put the lyrics to the funky beat
Ah rae rue, re rae rah
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away
Ah rae rue, re rae rah
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away

[Verse 2]
Me and i, myself and you
The rosta man, deshay and the rest of my crew
Reggae music's been around for a while
Vanilla ice is doin' it the hip hop style
Because this is the one that we call the rae rue
Everybody out there you know just what to do
Just clap your hands and stomp your feet
Move around to the sound of the reggae beat
No push, no fall, no shove, no trip
The rosta man wants you to get with it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well the people out there let me hear you scream
If you want to get down and you want to be seen
Then jump up my man, do the rosta man
Move your head up and down to the reggae jam
Just shake your arms and move your hips
All you females out there let me shake your
And just get down like you're makin' love
All you people who believe in god above

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
From the ah rae rue, the re rae rah
The jack tar village in jamaica
Ocho rios or the way to kingston
If we go back to the homeland again
Back on tour from city to city
Rollin' with the girls with the big, big ahhh..
Pity the fool who step it to me
I drop 'em like a fly, I better get the flea

Song:   Stop That train
Typed by: dallas112263@yahoo.com

1,2,3,4
It was an average night backstage at a show
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet
Her shape was so petite, and so unique
Her eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team
I was one of many that she'd choose
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm
This was far from a story you will find in a book
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain
And all I kept sayin' to myself was

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Oh my God, what have I got into?
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire
The situation I was in could've started a campfire
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you
You better watch your back 'cause a woman will slay you
Not to mention the one who got me
Yea, she got me, the I-C-E
But, back to the story of a one night stand
I thought I was strong but she was He-man
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush
And all 'n all it was for the lust
I though, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck
And out of all nights, where was my crew?
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do
D already told me that the girlie was strange
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss
Stop this train 'cause I wanna get off

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Later on that night as it got worse
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb

So, now what have I done to get myself into this?
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body
Why did I ever tell her to "Pump it, Hottie?"
What could I do to just ease the pain?
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain

Stop that train, I wanna' get off
Stop that train, I wanna' get off

Typed by: dallas112263@yahoo.com

Oh yea...In my dreams I envision myself at the ocean
Beautiful girls rubbin' me down with some lotion
Even though you know I flow as cold as an ice cube
Let me tell you how it is to make love on an inner tube
Floatin' on water while splashin' waves on your body
Flowni' and goin', now pump it, pump it, Hottie
See, I wanna get loose with you, is that all right?
Girl, I wanna' do it outside, under the moonlight
And get on down so we can make that love
You be the hand and Iceman'll be the glove
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures the utmost extreme

Yea...Life is just a fantasy...Yea..

Now, let me take you out so we can wine and dine
As I pull you close you pull your lips next to mine
Oh yeah, you like it like that
You like it like I do and that's where it's at
So later on that night as we got in my car
It started up again we didn't get very far
You made it very clear that you were not in fear
Leaned over to me and started kissin' my ear
Oh girl, you feel so good
You couldn't wait to get home and I understood
As we got busy, then I pulled up in the driveway
You said follow me 'cause we're gonna do it my way
Walked in the front door you startin' strippin' clothes
Turned off the lights and assumed the pose
Closer and closer, hot anticipation
You walked into the closet, came out in some lace and
I almost lost my mind, but I kept it in tact
The lace you was wearin' ohhh, I got an attack
'Cause this is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme


Yea...Life is just a fantasy
Yea...Life is just a fantasy

Come on baby and let me be your toy
I'll let you do as you wish just to give you joy
And get down, I know you wanna' get loose
Let's do it like a train and I'll be the caboose
Or better yet, I'll take you higher, I think that it's time
To make love to you baby on cloud number nine
As we start pumpin', sweat pour down my chest
And that's when you know Vanilla Ice is the best
You say ooh, ah, ooh, ooh, ah
I don't know what it means but I like it a lot
This is your fantasy, your highest dream
Fulfillin' all your pleasures to the utmost extreme
Yea...Life is just a fantasy
O yea...Life is just a fantasy...Oh girl...

Come on, come on, come on everybody
Come on, come on everybody
Come on everybody, come on, come on everybody
Come on, come on everybody
Let's do this dance
Get out your seats and let me shake your pants
Oh, with the base cold thumpin' and the hihats snaren'
People are jumpin' and the fly girls are staren'
People under 40...Yo! Let's get down
Because they need more break and now it's sliced by Shay
The records out so don't wait

The style that I'm doin', it'll ruin
All you people came here just for booin'
Get your dead ass up and back on the floor
Jump in the groove and let Vanilla go
Insane, with my gold chain
You know you're gonna' see it on Soul Train. Hit it!

Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'..

All you people on thel eft, shake your thing
And everybody on the right, do the same thing
Now, the people in the middle, try to enhance
Come on everybody, let me see you dance
In motion, with the potion
Get up everybody and locomotion
All swing and do your thing
Unless of course, you can't hang. Chillin' is o.k
But not when I play this song, move along, be gone
Yea! The beat'll make you move when the records on
Get with this style and update it
Like my record is, when you play it
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador
I saw my style, my soul up on the dance floor

Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'...Do it! Funk it up!
Dancin', Dancin', Dancin'..

Swingin' until the night is through
Just let your feet and your body take control of you
Just like a trance to keep you movin'
Everybody can do it, just keep on groovin'
Of the 808...just kickin' like a chicken that you just ate
So catch a groove so we can get down
Yell out the name of your hometown
Miami...Catch the groove. L.A....Catch the groove
New York...Catch the groove. Seattle...Catch the groove
Dallas...Catch the groove. Detroit...Catch the groove
VIP dancers...Catch the groove. Everybody...Catch the groove

Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby
All right stop, Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo -- I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance, go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, You better gain way
You better hit bull's eye, The kid don't play
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burnin' `em if you aint quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll, it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, Waving just to say Hi
Did you stop? No -- I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead

Yo -- so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of Eight Ball
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine -- All I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, You know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, This is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast, Other DJs say, "damn"
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem, Yo -- I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while Deshay revolves it
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla

Yo man -- Let's get out of here! Word to your mother!

Ice Ice Baby Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold
Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold, Ice Ice Baby Too cold Too cold
